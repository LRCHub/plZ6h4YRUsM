I want to remind you
You're the one who taught me alot
But I couln't fight you
Distance was too much

So hard I cried
I haven't felt behind
It's why I plead to you

Please believe me

I want to protect you
From all the breaking in your mind
I try to save you
But I fear I lost this fight

So hard you cried
I can't stop your tears
I hurt you deep inside
And it's killing me

Please believe me
