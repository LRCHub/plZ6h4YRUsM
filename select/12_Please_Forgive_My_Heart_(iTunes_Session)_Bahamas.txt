I could try to say I'm sorry But,
That won't be quite enough To let you know the pain that I feel And,
It just won't let up Oh,
It feels like the sky is falling And,
The clouds, clouds are closing in Where did I lose control?
Where did it all begin?
Please, forgive my heart It's not that the problem Lies anywhere in
There I'm a liar I'm in a dream Going on my way Nothing to rely on
There's a time A silent witness To the blindness of the night And,
We see reflections so clear In the blush,
Blush of the morning light Time can pass so slowly When you're faced
With burning down The time is not commuted It lingers,
Lingers without a sound Please,
Forgive my heart It's not that the problem Lies anywhere in there I'm
A liar I'm in a dream Going on my way Nothing to rely on Please,
Forgive my heart It's not that the problem Lies anywhere in
There I'm a liar I'm in a dream Going on my way Nothing to rely on
